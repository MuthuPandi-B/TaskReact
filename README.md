This project is a movie search application built using React.js, where users can search for movies using the OMDB API. The app displays search results in a user-friendly format, complete with movie posters, titles, and descriptions. Users can also view detailed information about a specific movie, including its poster, release year, genre, plot, ratings, and cast. Additionally, the app features a movie type filter and pagination for navigating through large search result sets.
